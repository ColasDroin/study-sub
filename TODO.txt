# TODO NEXT
- Finish debug study_sub and cluster_submission.py. This means:
    - ensure that path_job is consistent with the path that I obtained from node
    - adapt the submission to be done from object and not from dict


# TODO IN THE FUTURE

Make the submit script more verbose, what remains to be submitted etc.

Make the generate run recursive and not dependent on the generation

Handle singularity and docker images

Add rm statement at the end of sh run files -> Add a block to clean, it's way simpler and keep package separated from collider simulations
